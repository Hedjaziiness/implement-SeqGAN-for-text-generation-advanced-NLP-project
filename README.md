***GAN : Generative Adversial Network***
 its a type of neural network that used in machine learning to generate new data that looks similar to a given data.
 
 it consists of two main components:
***Generator***: its a neural network takes input and tries to generate data that looks realistic enough.
**Discriminator**: its also a neural network , it takes both real data from the dataset and fake data from the generator as input and tries to do a binary classification, if it as real or fake.
These two networks are compeeting to win if we could say, at some point, the generator gets so good at creating realistic data that the discriminator wont descriminate .

applications of GAN : -Image to Image translation
                      -Image to Text / Text to Image translation
                      -Deep Fake
